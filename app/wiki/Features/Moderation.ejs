<h1>Moderation</h1>
The Moderation system has many useful features, but it should be configured properly, and it's good to know some quirks of it.

</br>
</br>
<h3>Features</h3>
The Moderation System has many <b>critical</b> features, like <a href="/commands/Moderation#mute" >mutes</a>, <a href="/commands/Moderation#purge" >message purging</a>, and more!

</br>  </br> 
<h3>How it Works</h3>
There are two ways to execute Moderation Commands, with the Moderator Role
(configurable with the
<code
	><a  href="/commands/Configuration#modrole"
		><%= prefix %>modrole</a
	></code
>
command), or by simply having the permission.
</br>
The <code
	><a  href="/commands/Configuration#modrole"
		>modrole</a
	></code
> command allows you to have a "Moderator" role that you can give to users, that has no permissions attached to it.
</br> This forces your Moderators to take all of moderaton actions through the bot.
</br>All moderation commands can be used with this role <b>EXCEPT</b> kick, ban, and unban.
This is done just in case you don't want moderators to have access to those permissions, if you do though, just give the Moderator role the appropriate permissions.

</br> </br>
<h3>Setting up the Moderator Role</h3>
To setup the Moderator role, use the <code
	><a  href="/commands/Configuration#modrole"
		><%= prefix %>modrole</a
	></code
> command.

<ol>
    <li>Create a Special Moderator Role, it doesn't need any permissions attached.</li>
    <li>Run the <code><%= prefix %>modrole &lt;role&gt;</code> command. This will save the role into the Database, and will allow members with this role to use most Moderation commands.</li>
</ol>

</br> 
<h3>Setting up the Muted Role</h3>
To setup the Muted role, use the <code
	><a  href="/commands/Configuration#muterole"
		><%= prefix %>muterole</a
	></code
> command.
This will be given to members when they are muted by a moderator, and when they are unmuted/when their mute expires.

<ol>
    <li>Create a Special "Muted" Role, at least take away the "Send Messages" permission.</li>
    <li>Run the <code><%= prefix %>muterole &lt;role&gt;</code> command. This will save the role into the Database, be automatically assigned to members when they are muted.</li>
</ol>

</br>
<h3 id="filter">Setting up the Word Filter</h3>
The filter is configurable, and allows for Server Administrators, as well as Moderators to add to it, remove from it, enable, or disable it.

To setup the Filter, use the <code
	><a  href="/commands/Configuration#filter"
		><%= prefix %>filter</a
	></code
> command.

</br> </br>

<h4>Setup</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Enable the filter with <code><%= prefix %>filter enable</code>, this will turn it on, but with no phrases added to it!</li>
	<li>Add phrases to the filter with <code><%= prefix %>filter add &lt;phrase&gt;</code>, this will add the phrase into the filter, and will automatically delete a message that contains this phrase.</li>
</ol>
Congratulations! You have just set up the filter!

</br> </br>
<h4>Subcommands</h4>
<ul>
	<li><code>enable</code> Enable the Filter</li>
	<li><code>disable</code> Disable the Filter</li>
	<li><code>list</code> List all Phrases in the Filter</li>
	<li><code>add &lt;phrase&gt;</code> Add a Phrase to the Filter</li>
	<li><code>remove &lt;phrase&gt;</code> Remove a Phrase from the Filter</li>
</ul>
