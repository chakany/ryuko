<h1 align="center">Aina</h1>
Aina is one of my side-projects.

## Running
To run Aina, you will need some prerequistes:
`yarn`, A [lavalink](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink) node, and an instance of MariaDB that is accessable.

You are going to want to make a copy of the config template, and fill in all of the details yourself.

Then, build with `yarn dist`, and then run with `yarn start`.
